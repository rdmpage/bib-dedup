The female, pupa and larva of P. acuminatus are described for the first time, from Chile; all stages of P. escondido Cranston &amp; A\u00f1\u00f3n Su\u00e1rez, sp. n., are described from lentic patagonian Argentina, all stages of Parapsectrocladius reissi sp. n. from a pond in Valdivia, Chile, and P. longistylus sp. n. from males from several locations in south Chile and Argentina and the putatively associated female and pupa from southern Chile. The clade is Patagonian, with larvae occurring in Andean pools, ponds and lakes, including glacial-fed ones, and also in one lowland river in Chiloe. Previous suggested relationships to Cardiocladius Kieffer or Paratrissocladius Zavrel are rejected following phylogenetic analysis, with these placements suggested as due to adult male -based convergent character states. The immature stages, which show resemblance to Psectrocladius Kieffer and Rheocricotopus Thienemann &amp; Harnisch, and the female contribute evidence that Parapsectrocladius forms the sister group to Psectrocladius, which appears monophyletic despite its subgeneric heterogeneity. Immediate next relations to Psectrocladius + Parapsectrocladius are postulated as (Rheocricotopus (both subgenera) + Paracricotopus) then (Nanocladius + Doncricotopus) at next remove.<\/jats:p>\n         <\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1163\/187631200x00345","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2010,7,3]],"date-time":"2010-07-03T13:22:01Z","timestamp":1278163321000},"page":"103-120","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Parapsectrocladius: a new genus of orthocladiine Chironomidae (Diptera) from Patagonia, the southern Andes"],"prefix":"10.1163","volume":"31","author":[{"given":"Peter S.","family":"Cranston","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"1P.

However, the identity of the causal agents has not yet been investigated. Between August 2008 and June 2010, wood samples from branches of almond trees showing internal necroses and brown to black vascular streaking were collected in the Llevant region on the island of Mallorca.Several fungal species were subsequently isolated from the margin between healthy and symptomatic tissue. Five species of Botryosphaeriaceae (namely Botryosphaeria dothidea, Diplodia olivarum, D. seriata, Neofusicoccum australe and N. parvum), Eutypa lata, Phaeoacremonium iranianum and Phomopsis amygdali were identified based on morphology, culture characteristics and DNA sequence comparisons. Neofusicoccum parvum was the dominant species, followed by E. lata, D. olivarum and N. australe. First reports from almond include D. olivarum and Pm. iranianum. Two species are newly described, namely Collophora hispanica sp. nov. and Phaeoacremonium amygdalinum sp. nov.","type":"article-journal","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012]]},"author":[{"given":"D","family":"Gramaje"},{"given":"C","family":"Agustí-Brisach"},{"given":"A","family":"Pérez-Sierra"},{"given":"E","family":"Moralejo"},{"given":"D","family":"Olmo"},{"given":"L","family":"Mostert"},{"given":"U","family":"Damm"},{"given":"J","family":"Armengol"}],"container-title":"Persoonia - Molecular Phylogeny And Evolution of Fungi","volume":"28","issue":"1","page":"1-13","page-first":"1","ISSN":["0031-5850"],"alternative-id":["oai:ARNO:532415","http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/record/532415","http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/570241"],"link":[{"URL":"http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/570241","content-type":"application/pdf"}],"URL":"http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/record/532415"},1]
